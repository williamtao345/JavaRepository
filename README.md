####  `System.out.println("Welcome to my Java Repository!");`
# Introduction
## Who am I?
+ I am a 9th Grader who have learned C, Python, Javascript and who is learning Java now.
+ I am good at Math(no kidding). I have finished Database by myself last summer-break, and I am taking AP Calculus BC and AP Computer Science A now.
## Why I created this repository?
1. Save the work I have done about Java
2. Record my Java learning process
